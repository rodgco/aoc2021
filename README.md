Learning Rust while helping to save Christmas this year again!!!

# Tools

Using the helpfull AOC library from Rémi Dupré, it abstracts all the work to load input files, and also times execution.

# Journal

## Day 1

* Spent a lot of time setting up a Rust project and learning the basis to structure my code.
* Found this great library (see tools) that helps with all the boilerplate of downloading inputs, reading files and timing executions.
* Challenge was easy, just struggled a little bit on the details of Rust.

## Day 2

* Started refactoring day 1 into a separate module and created a template I can use to spawn a new file.
* Challenge was easy.
* Learned a bit more about tuples in Rust.

## Day 3

* Again, not hard to solve. But spent two days on this one (not full days, I've had other things to do).
* Rust concepts are hard... the new kid on the block: lifetimes!!!

## Day 4

* What a difficult task! Struggled a few days to *not solve* this.
* Rust typing is hard to grasp!!!
* In the took a look at some other solutions on Rust on Github, and adapted one for my case!
* Copy with pride!!!
* PS: Gotta finda the original again to give credits!!!
